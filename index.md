> ## Prerequisites
>
> To complete this lesson, you will need a UNIX-like shell environment -see [Setup](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-shell/setup/). You will also need to download the file **[dp-lesson.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librarycarpentry/lc-dig-pres/gh-pages/data/dp-lesson.zip)** from GitHub to your *desktop* and extract it there (once you have unzipped/extracted the file, you should end up with a folder called "dp-lesson"). It is recommended that you complete the lesson [Shell Lessons for Librarians](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-shell/) if you are not familiar with the shell.
